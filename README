to compile the program, simply type
$ make

to get your current hosts ip-address
$ hostname -i

to run the server, type
$ ./server [port]

to run the client, type
$ ./client [port] [ip-address]

client can be run with an input file
$ ./client [port] [ip-address] <[input]

pdfs are created of both of the man pages,
in the names server.pdf and client.pdf

to view the man pages in the terminal, type
$ groff -Tascii -man [filename]

Note: the man pages for server and client have the naming convention "*.man"
